### Types of Published Content

- <a href="/posts/" target="_blank"><strong>Notes</strong></a> — life posts, updates on the project.
- <a href="/articles/" target="_blank"><strong>Articles</strong></a> — my articles about works in the horror genre, cyberpunk subgenres, science fiction, and fantasy (particularly dark fantasy).
- <a href="/stories/" target="_blank"><strong>Stories</strong></a> — this section features the web magazine *Spirits Show*.

#### Spirits Show

*Spirits Show* is an interactive series in the horror and dark comedy genres. The title is a play on words. At some point, I might tell a separate story about a liquor trader who faces export problems due to an outbreak of war and decides to repurpose his business. I am certainly inspired by spiritual séances that were popular during World War I, as well as *The Cabin in the Woods* from *Gravity Falls*.

This section is directly connected to the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRSQ_MvJCAAgpwDfSlsxjm9BasAn61rB0&si=XXDnGKBleC7qy4WO" target="_blank"><strong>"Stories" playlist</strong></a> on my YouTube channel, AI-generated content on Instagram, and platforms where I publish stories.

- <a href="/library/" target="_blank"><strong>Library</strong></a> — a library where I gradually add all studied works and, as a result, write reviews. This section is linked to the *Gourmet* playlist. I started adding my favorite and most significant works based on a timeline that begins with *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley, so it's important to understand that I plan to review a lot of works. However, modern works that I find essential will also appear out of order.

### Project Categories

Categories allow for the content to be grouped thematically:

- <a href="/categories/my-insights/" target="_blank"><strong>My Insights</strong></a> — materials where I present my perspective. Usually, these are extensive thoughts from the *Articles* section.
- <a href="/categories/my-life/" target="_blank"><strong>My Life</strong></a> — events from my life (mostly content from the *Notes* section).
- <a href="" target="_blank"><strong>My Projects</strong></a> — my projects, detailed descriptions of the ideas behind them (including, for example, AI generation prompts), as well as project engagement calls (such as polls).
- <a href="/categories/my-reviews/" target="_blank"><strong>My Reviews</strong></a> — my reviews, published in the *Library* section, but this category may also be used for other types of content.

### Content Filtering Methods

The site features specialized content collections that allow for strict filtering based on specific topics:

- <a href="/series/" target="_blank"><strong>Series</strong></a> — collections of materials unified by a common idea, atmosphere, or other criteria.
- <a href="/tags/" target="_blank"><strong>Tags</strong></a> — the standard method of filtering content by keywords.

### Phantom Draft Subprojects

These projects exist separately from the main site but frequently reference it or enhance it with unique content.

Drafts of my works or random AI-generated content do not appear on Instagram — they can be found in the dedicated Telegram channel.

The channel is named after the interactive journal mentioned earlier. Videos on the channel either concisely present information related to materials on the site or are purely for entertainment.

	<div class="t_center castration base_width p_relative">
		<h2>Doomform</h2>
		<p><a href="" target="_blank"><strong>Epic Cringe on TikTok</strong></a></p>
	</div>
</div>

I am unlikely to seriously develop a TikTok presence, but sometimes I have ideas for short looping videos. These are usually something both epic and cringe-worthy.
