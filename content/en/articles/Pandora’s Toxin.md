Once, I Thought About the Influence of Narcotic Substances on Horror Movie Characters. Horror is primarily a speculative genre. In my opinion, horror struggles to promote self-destruction or violence in modern society, let alone predict social issues for the near future. However, some people claim to think otherwise (<a href="/articles/the-idea-of-apocalypse-in-horror-films-particularly-slashers-films/" target="_blank">post</a>).

## Horrors About Drugs

I became interested in how realistic the behavior of horror characters is when using narcotics. The precedent for my reflections was the movie Cabin Fever (2002). However, due to the opinions of impressionable critics, as mentioned above, I want to clarify:

* I do not promote drug use.  
* I do not believe this genre is capable of positively developing this theme.

### The First Biological Weapon in the World

Strictly speaking, I consider narcotics the first biological weapon on the planet. And if you think they are harmless or incapable of scaling, like the peyote god-drink used in Native American Church ceremonies to this day—read these books:

* **The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams, and the Making of Modern China** – a book included in the Oxford Library.  
* **Confessions of an English Opium Eater (1821)** – a firsthand account of the Opium Wars. De Quincey continues his thoughts in Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow.  
* **One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest** – a book by Ken Kesey, a cult figure among hippies and Beatniks. He started by participating in experiments on the insane and then became so engrossed in the idea that he began advocating for drug legalization.  
* <a href="/library/acid-dreams-1985/" target="_blank">Acid Dreams (The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, The Sixties, and Beyond)</a> – about BZ, a military-grade combat drug.  
* **Addiction and Its Human** – a book by Marat Aginyan, offering a modern alternative to historical cases of gnosis stimulation through opium bread or Viking black henbane.

Alcohol and narcotics are an integral part of the cyclical overheating of the global economy.  
This is why they are deeply embedded in the cultures of many countries. I believe it is not useless to give this originally curiosity-driven selection an anti-drug propaganda context. But more on that—and on alternatives—in the conclusion of this article.

### My Sources

I spent some time trying to understand what was happening in these works.

1. I visited the websites of the Ministries of Internal Affairs of several countries and studied their drug information pamphlets. Based on data provided by law enforcement agencies, I compiled a list of the most popular drugs worldwide (Europe, Russia, and the USA). The context of substance use is often chaotic and depends on socioeconomic factors (see point 3\) and social groups.  
2. My primary source of information was the English Wikipedia, which helped classify these poisons by chemical groups.  
3. With a basic understanding of where and when certain drugs were used en masse at the state level, I drew my own conclusions, which helped me assess the average influence of specific substances on people.  
4. Key Selection Criterion: in my understanding, a pimple horror movie is "How to Get Ahead in Advertising", not just a surprise pimple that the protagonist of "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" found unattractive. I did not include numerous horror movies where drugs are not a central part of the plot but are merely a crutch for an inexperienced screenwriter.

## Horror Movies About Cannabis

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>
		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/marijuana.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Horror Movies About Cannabis">
	</p>
	<p>Cannabis-based drugs: Marijuana, Hashish</p>
	<p>Active substances: Cannabinoids</p>
</div>

Not everyone knows that during the filming of the old BBC series Teletubbies, the crew used drugs. So, the horror films about cannabis that I know of are like Teletubbies on minimal settings—where the characters are either idiots or divinely gifted. I will mention one movie specifically dedicated to this type of drug and one more film I simply cannot ignore. In the first case, the protagonists are just idiots. In the second, perhaps they really are divinely gifted... by someone.

### Star Leaf (2015)

The main characters discover a plantation of extraterrestrial weed. However, there are three rules on the premises:

1. You can only smoke.
2. You cannot take photos.
3. You cannot take anything with you.

The heroes break all three rules—and unleash the wrath of an intergalactic drug lord.

Just kidding about the last part—it's just an alien organism. I doubt the creature considers itself a baron.

### The Cabin in the Woods (2011)

One of my favorite black comedies, The Cabin in the Woods (2011), belongs to the "Post-Horror We Deserve" selection. The constant use of weed helped the character Marty develop immunity to the fictional corporation’s chemical weapon, and that struck me as funny. Like cures like.

## Horror Movies About Psilocybin

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>
		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/psilocybin.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Horror Movies About Psilocybin">
	</p>
	<p>Hallucinogens</p>
	<p>Psilocin and Psilocybin—commonly referred to as "shrooms" or "toadstools"</p>
</div>

The problem of direction is as old as Wagnerian opera, where horned helmets and armored bras were costume designer Carl Döpler’s blessing upon gods, Vikings, and valkyries. These clichés go hand in hand with another: the idea that consuming poisonous mushrooms (not only psilocybin but also fly agarics) somehow stimulates muscle growth and increases aggression (this explains why berserkers died quickly in battle—because these were not the most suitable poisons for enhancing physical activity). Where did they even find all these different mushrooms?

Recently, botanist and ethnographer Carsten Fatur suggested that berserkers may have consumed Black Henbane—a plant containing powerful alkaloids, which was common in the harsh lands of Scandinavia. However, there is still no movie about this, no books written, and no songs sung.

### Shrooms (2007)

I would love to watch a movie where people transform into bears after eating mandrake, but I cannot and do not want to watch this. A typical misuse of poison outside its "intended purpose". They might as well have invented their own fictional drug.

### Hagazussa (2017)

In this film, the protagonist not only consumes unprocessed mushrooms but also experiences immense mental and physical stress:

* Political persecution of "witches".
* A raging epidemic.
* She was, in fact, a "witch" and did not believe in the new God.  
* She had a newborn child.
* The people who accepted the new God raped her when they found out she was a pagan.
* Her mother died when she was a child.

A hard life.

During the Viewing of This Film, I Remembered the "Mortal Lullabies" from Russia. Some people interpret them as a "reverse evil eye", meant to protect a child from evil spirits. Others, who can evaluate past epochs more objectively, rather than through rose-colored glasses ("Oh, you're pregnant? What a joy\!"), argue that mothers, tormented by everyday hardships, literally wished death upon their children because they were unwanted.

The episode of the heroine consuming mushrooms in the film might not have been a one-time occurrence—it could have been repeated on an ongoing basis, which changes the situation. However, the girl did not uproot trees with her bare hands, nor did she rip out the spines of her abusers. Instead, she quietly went insane, dabbling in sabotage, relaxing with poisons, and—by the way—it’s worth considering the likelihood of the paranormal being present in her life, which ultimately took her away with it.

And So, She Was Saved.

### Without Name (2016)

A low-budget arthouse film about psilocybin. A man brewed decoctions from various mushrooms. The toxicity in these decoctions was different, and judging by everything, not limited to psilocybin alone.

The Man Did Not Terrify Society—He Simply Left It, Driven Insane. Interpreting this is not too difficult: he did what he had long wanted to do, but couldn’t, due to moral aspects and a sense of duty to his family. As a result of drug use, the man experienced a "reset" of social norms.

### Midsommar (2019) by A24

Despite a number of circumstances that unfolded exactly as shown in the film—which at times feels like sheer bad luck—the plot moves forward like a ship from the movie Full Steam Ahead\!—continuous and straight to its destination.

What Did I Feel After Watching This Not-So-Short Film?

I felt like I had spied on God going to the bathroom—under the condition that I had never encountered gods before. It had never even crossed my mind that a god would need to use the toilet\! But he did it so naturally that I whispered in awe: — "In your image and likeness."

This is nothing like Tarantino’s Hostel, where you start wondering if the director has paranoia. Here, everything is banally simple, yet due to the isolation of this place—which doesn't even try to hide itself—I began to wonder: could this place actually exist? It has its own atmosphere. It is not part of Myanmar’s wildlands. It is a popular tourist destination for wealthy people.

The Portrayal of Psilocybin Mushroom Consumption in This Film Seemed Realistic to Me. Which is why, of course, I included this film in my selection.

## Horror Movies About Dissociatives, Deliriants, and Psychedelics (LSD)

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>
		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/psychedelics.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Horror Movies About Dissociatives, Deliriants, and Psychedelics (LSD)">
	</p>
	<p>BZ – a military-grade combat drug. LSD – also known as "acid" or "tabs."</p>
	<p>This is a group of psychedelic substances that alter consciousness.</p>
</div>

Welcome to the World of LSD Horror Movies. Currently, LSD is the most sexualized drug in the horror genre. This is superficially (literally) linked to the method of consuming LSD tabs, which has become a tribute to porn culture and the concept of a "cumshot." And it doesn’t matter that: placing a tab under the tongue is more logical, because absorption is better there. No. They all place them on top.

Most acid horror movies are just that—"naked and funny." But not all of them. There is one particularly serious project that lurks in the background like a shadow of all these tongues sticking out… And it belongs in the section on fictional drugs—but alas. "Stay with us, boy. You will be our king." /c

### Jacob’s Ladder (1990)

*"Lice, as if a man, carved from fire" — Jacob’s comment on the descent.*

Jacob’s Ladder from his dream, by which the biblical figure Christ descended to Earth. A detailed description of Jacob’s Ladder exists in the Apocrypha under the same name, describing the meaning of each of the 12 steps. There are many ancient references to Jewish traditions. But personally, I am reminded of Bifröst—the Rainbow Bridge (after all, we are talking about psychedelics).

#### What You Need to Know About This Film

Jacob’s Ladder is not a film about fictional drugs but about real chemical weapons. The substance mentioned in the film is inspired by a very real compound, BZ (3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate), a standard-issue incapacitating agent of the U.S. Army, which was tested on American soldiers during the Vietnam War. The production of this toxin was extensive—there was a dedicated plant specifically manufacturing BZ. Later, it was also synthesized within the USSR for research purposes (no recorded cases of mass deployment). BZ is a deliriant, and its production is closely monitored, as it is used as a basis for hallucinogenic drugs.

#### Plot of Jacob’s Ladder (1990)

A man named Jacob Singer is wounded during the Vietnam War and, as a result, returns home to New York. However, instead of finding freedom, he experiences the opposite: рorrific memories of family tragedies. A painful divorce. The war, which seems over, still haunts him. Meanwhile, he begins to see terrifying hallucinations—and soon learns that his fellow soldiers are seeing them too.

### Stalin's Acid (Сталинская кислота, 2016)

*Short film.*

"Stalin's Acid" continues the discussion of BZ mentioned above while simultaneously narrating events described in the book Mystical Phenomena of the Human Psyche (1959) by Leonid Vasilyev.

Initially, I Thought "Stalin's Acid" Was Just a Creepypasta. I expected something along the lines of: "The Russian Sleep Experiment", where five prisoners were kept awake and ended up eating themselves—like the fox from von Trier’s Antichrist. And, of course, some philosophical conversations. But no. Everything here stays within the realm of reality.

### Devil's Acid (2018)

An example of the aforementioned "tongue-showing" film. A low-budget movie dedicated to a so-called "trip"—without any hint of the "otherworldly." This is purely the horrors of real life.

## Horror Movies About Fictional Drugs

<div class="castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>By spending a little time on lore, one can create a fictional drug that fits seamlessly into the everyday lives of any characters, only to tragically destroy them or alter their existence to the level described in High on Life. Unfortunately, it sometimes feels like many authors rely solely on subjective, Lovecraftian-style descriptions of the "indescribable," and their only references are fan art of Venom.</p>
</div>

I have selected a few interesting works that I personally liked. "Body Melt" (1993) is not included here because I didn’t particularly enjoy it, but still—I've mentioned it (just now, actually).

### The Evil in Us (2016)

The film was criticized, but I honestly don’t understand why. It is both cynical and ironic—everything fits together well. Thanks to its ending, it doesn’t get lost among the stream of "not-so-generic horror films."

### To Kill the Dragon (2019)

I will not give this film a higher rating out of pity simply because of its "idea." I strongly recommend watching it in its original voiceover with subtitles—just like The Bouquet. In fact, I always recommend watching non-Hollywood films with subs rather than dubbing, unless you speak the language fluently.

The next two films are somewhat "about Venom."

### Discarnate (2018)

This movie is a great example of "films about fictional drugs," where a lot of attention is paid to isolation and the personal tragedies of the characters. The circumstances of the film’s dynamic opening are firmly lodged in my memory.

This ended up being a "review for the sake of completion," but I wrote it sincerely, and I have nothing to add.

### Hausen (2020)

Another good example of a film about a fictional drug that surprises with the way some obvious cringe-worthy elements are explained straight-faced through metaphors about the meaning of life—and, strangely enough, I bought into it.

The viewer follows the exploits of a local homeless man who manages to synthesize and convert alien slime into a drug, which soon becomes abused by an entire apartment complex.

Does that sound horrible? Then turn it on and start watching. A missing child locked in an oven, whom his parents try to save. And much more that will soon make you forget my comedic description. Despite a touch of absurdity, you might even find yourself sympathizing with some of the characters… Because here, everything drips with metaphor.

Sniff, eat, drink, inhale your world, Homo sapiens.

## Horror Movies About Opium

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">

		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/opium.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Horror Movies About Opium">
	</p>
	<p>Opiates</p>
	<p>Heroin, Methadone</p>
	<p>All natural narcotic substances in the opium group are derived from poppies</p>
</div>

There is only one film here, but you could also watch "From Hell," where a young Johnny Depp hangs out in an Eastern opium den.

### Gothic (1986)

It hits, forgive me, like bohemian youth during the era of galvanization experiments—entirely within normal limits, if we judge by sources describing the effects of opiates. A breast with eyes? That's normal. All of this is within the norm.

**Bonus Section\!**
Before I wrap up the topic of drugs (for which people can be imprisoned) and move on to substances legally available to all adults (alcohol, nicotine, etc.), here are two micro-selections that I deliberately left out of the previous sections.

## Alone With Oneself – Three Horror Movies About What Happens When You "Climb Up" or "Climb Down" Incorrectly

These films do not fit into any of the categories above, but they all attempt to be educational.

### Toad Road (2012)

*Something between LSD and mushrooms (both substances are consumed in the film).*

Here’s a quote from a review I once read about this film:

<div class="castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p><em>"His film is a New Age mockumentary, post-doc, a small technical revolution. It is a powerful hybrid of reality and artistic fiction: everything turns into mysticism, which is constantly reinforced by facts. In content, it seems like a classic legend-checking sketch, but if you look closer, you can find the outlines of a dark horror film—and behind the genre’s outlines, a tragic story of a lost soul." /c</em></p>
</div>

I wouldn't have been as surprised to read such a review about The Green Elephant, because in that case, it would have been obvious sarcasm. I had one question:

* "Did you really like this film that much, or are you always in *this state*?" \*Lowered my glasses and furrowed my brows in disapproval.\* By the way, this is not a mockumentary.

#### About the Film

This movie was shot by a group of friends. During filming, the director told them to act as naturally as possible—so they drank real alcohol and took real drugs. One of the director’s friends, Sarah, disappeared while they were tripping in the woods, searching for the "Toad Road." The film is dedicated to her. Two Months After the Film's Release, Sarah Died of an Overdose. A literal retelling of the plot would sound like a police report on a theater siege by terrorists. Yet, the reviewer manages to focus not on the film’s plot or message ("the path of a drug addict leads nowhere"), but rather to glorify Sarah—as if she had been consciously sacrificed for art.

#### Da, Das ist Mein Teil\!

The difference between this film and the real-life story of two German men, where one ate the other, is that: the Germans did this by mutual consent, and they understood the finality of their actions.

#### She Didn’t Disappear—She Died

The climax of Toad Road—*"Am I guilty of you disappearing?"*—should be delivered without a question mark. Because, in reality, Sarah didn’t disappear. **Sarah died**. First, she died of an overdose in the film. Then, she died of an overdose in real life.

This reminds me of Vysotsky and his lyrics: *"Those who voluntarily accepted suffering—this song is written for you."* Poet, did you really accept suffering? Are you some kind of Forged from Fallout? Or perhaps even Darth Sion, resurrected by pain?

#### Somewhere in the Woods, Vysotsky Was Waiting for Them

In Toad Road, the teenagers were searching for an abandoned mental asylum in the woods, but they couldn’t find it. Vysotsky wrote his songs from a psychiatric hospital’s drug addiction ward, where he was undergoing treatment.

All of this is a powerful example of the infantilism of immature people, which, in my opinion, can and should be used in storytelling. But without leaving behind a "bitter aftertaste"—Instead, drenching the audience in a bucket of ice-cold water at the end.

#### Romanticizing Death & Poe’s Alcoholism

At the beginning of this article, I said that horror cannot promote self-destruction. And I was right. Horror, on its own, cannot make a person kill themselves or others. But romanticizing death—That is the very "Poe-esque Gothic" that teenagers and anxious minds fall in love with. An Example of Such a Girl in the Story "Count the Ways".

One should not forget that Poe drank himself to death and died in poverty, begging God for help. Meanwhile, Stephen King, with all his problems resolved, once said:

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p><em>"Pop your pills and quit whining."</em></p>
</div>

### Close Callc (2017)

A schoolgirl…

</div>

...stays home alone when her widowed father goes on a date with his new partner. The girl expects to have a great time but makes a mistake. After a line of cocaine and a joint of weed, someone begins to terrorize her over the phone.

### Dry Blood (2017)

A drug addict retreats into the wilderness in an attempt to break free from his addiction and is left alone with his hallucinations. Apparently, people do not always have the opportunity to seek medical help, and that is a problem.

## Two Movies Where People Create a New Drug and Try to Take Over the World

These two are remarkable in that they are as similar as relatives.

### Cookers (2001)

A husband and wife set up a drug lab in a place where dark rituals were once performed and a sorcerer lived.

### Flakka 666 (2021)

A sorcerer creates a new drug, but drug lords ignore his product. The sorcerer gets angry and plans revenge, while the drug has already reached the masses, and Chaos reigns over everything.

No, this is not a sequel and prequel that devoted fans shot 20 years apart. These are two separate movies.

## Horrors About Nicotine

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">

		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/nicotine.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Horrors About Nicotine">
	</p>
	<p>I would appreciate any suggestions for horror movies about cigarettes, but for now, there's only one Indian film adaptation of Stephen King's short story "Quitters, Inc."</p>
</div>

### No Smoking (2007)

A successful businessman becomes so addicted to smoking that he can't live without a cigarette for a single minute. This greatly worsens his life. His wife leaves him, and he begins to have problems at work. Following the advice of his friend Abbas, he decides to visit a clinic that guarantees a 100% success rate in quitting smoking.

## Horrors About Alcohol

<div class="castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p><em>A Goblin, a Fairy, and an Elephant walk into a pub. They're all green…</em></p>
</div>

There are plenty of horror movies where people drink alcohol. The consequences of drinking for the characters vary. Sometimes, alcohol affects what happens to a character in a game, but more often, it complicates a successful resolution of a given situation. I have selected movies where this is not as obvious, and alcohol seems to be the central theme of the plot.

### The Lighthouse (2019)

Set in the 1890s, somewhere near the coast of New England, the story follows a young man, Ephraim Winslow, who arrives on a remote island to work as the new assistant to the lighthouse keeper, the crippled, bearded, heavy-drinking Thomas Wake. Wake treats his subordinate like a personal slave and forbids him from entering the lighthouse tower or operating the light. Ephraim is haunted by his past, and although he initially refuses alcohol, he gradually succumbs to drinking. Soon, on the rocky island, strange and eerie things begin to happen—whether they are real or hallucinations remains uncertain.

I highly recommend watching it in its original language with subtitles, as Robert Pattinson's accent is based on the farmer dialect of Maine, while Willem Dafoe uses the jargon of Atlantic sailors of that time, making it incredibly atmospheric.

### Sennentuntschi (2010)

<div class="t_center castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>
		<img class="miner fl" src="/images/articles/horror-about-drugs/absinthe.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Shepherd’s Doll (2010)">
	</p>
	<p>Wormwood = Absinthe or the Green Fairy</p>
	<p>This drink contains thujone, a compound chemically similar to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient found in marijuana and hashish</p>
</div>

The Green Fairy has had a full life—a mysterious birth with multiple versions, a rise, a fall, and a return from oblivion.

Here’s an incomplete list of famous people who were addicted to absinthe: Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Captain Jack Sparrow, and others. Looking at this list, it becomes clear that the healthcare systems of most countries would inevitably take issue with a drink consumed by all these people… But no, not everywhere. In Russia, there were no bans on absinthe, and to this day, it remains available. The EU and the USA have imposed restrictions on thujone content, limiting it to 10 mg/kg. However, in 2008, the EU raised the limit to 35 mg/kg. Meanwhile, the lucky inhabitants of the Distant and Cold lands can legally purchase the "Van Gogh" homemade absinthe, where the thujone content is even higher—or at least, that’s what I was told, though this could be just a marketing ploy.

Once upon a time, Shepherd’s Doll pleasantly surprised me. I had a similar experience when watching Gothic (1986). When I started watching these films, I expected much less.

**Plot Summary**: Swiss Alps, 1975\. Shortly after the suicide of the local priest, a mysterious girl appears in the mountain village of Trepunt. She behaves strangely, doesn’t speak, and is deathly afraid of crosses and crucifixes. Because of this, the villagers begin to suspect her of being a witch. The only one who stands up for her is police officer Reusch. Soon, a tragic accident involving the mayor’s wife occurs in Trepunt, and the mysterious girl is implicated again. After this, it becomes increasingly difficult for Reusch to contain the superstitious rage of the villagers.

Absinthe may serve as a gateway into a real tunnel of nightmares, and whether or not the tunnel was real—each viewer decides for themselves.

## Horrors About Antidepressants

I remember a couple of thrillers and a comedy, but I couldn’t fit them into this list.

<div class="castration cover p_relative atcScreen">
	<p>“Antidepressants aren't just a post-Soviet phenomenon” is a lazy excuse for hype that persists to this day. If not alcohol, then what else do you use to treat emotional wounds in a place where people have been conditioned to perceive the cries of the soul as meaningless noise? Who even needs these pills?!</p>
</div>

Although no one forbids combining them: you can go to a psychologist and then wash down a pill with vodka, but it's better to go with a comrade—so it won't be as embarrassing, and there will be someone to call an ambulance during this new, unexplored withdrawal.

### Little Joe (2019)

Alice has recently divorced and is raising her teenage son, Joe. She works at a biology institute, where she develops a new species of plant for a flower fair. This plant, when properly cared for, is designed to make its owner happy. The flower has passed all hypoallergenic tests, so Alice takes one home for her son and names it "Little Joe". But soon, she begins to suspect that this little red flower is affecting those who inhale its pollen in a strange way.

This movie reminded me of "Splice", "The Babadook" on a minimal budget, and "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986).

## Dependency—The Key is Wanting It

Talking About Mushrooms some people claim that consuming psychedelic mushrooms led to an expansion of their consciousness. However, this is simply the breakdown of social norms, which turned out to be incompatible with the lifestyle of newly minted drug users. These norms are so deeply ingrained in people's consciousness, and their violation is so strongly condemned, that it may be impossible to break free from them without the help of substances. This explains why psilocybin started being used in psychiatry. Often, drug addicts (and I mean alcoholics as well) develop a "symbiosis", expressed in their shared belief that they are not responsible for their own lives. In such cases, using drugs together almost inevitably leads to someone’s downfall—in nearly 100% of cases.

I started smoking at the age of 15, not because I needed to, but because everyone around me smoked. I have tried to quit three times and have firmly realized that the psychological attachment to nicotine is just as strong as the physical one. I have not quit smoking, and I will most likely not quit in the next ten years, because my life is too stressful. My body is only getting older, and enduring stress is becoming harder than slowly poisoning myself.

Would I Have Stopped My Younger Self From Smoking? Yes, absolutely.  
Do I Want to Quit Smoking Now? Yes, I do.

My wife and I have been married for 10 years and have been in a relationship for about 15 years. Our son is 7 years old. I have been smoking for 2-3 years longer than I have been in a relationship with my wife. I remember my transition into adulthood with nicotine, and nicotine remembers even more than I do. Many things have disappeared from my life, but nicotine has remained.

Did I Ever Think That Smoking Would Become a Part of My Family? No. But when I was young, I was convinced that I would eventually start smoking, because everyone around me did. It seemed normal, a social anchor that had to be dropped—otherwise, I would drift too far away from people. If everyone in my social circle had been using drugs, then, without a doubt, I would have most likely started using them too. This highlights the issue, as well as the reason for my pedantic approach in this article.

If your friends use drugs, and you have no clear direction in life—as I once didn’t—then my only advice is to joke your way out of it and focus on the fact that you are capable of socializing without substances. But ultimately, it all depends on the situation. If the people offering you drugs aren’t your peers, but older individuals, then this could be a very concerning sign.

### Final Thoughts

To sum up, I remind you that drug distribution leads to criminal prosecution. Also, the synthesis of what you consume is often first tested for military purposes. There is a lot in our lives that originated from the military sector—here’s an article on that.

### To Writers
