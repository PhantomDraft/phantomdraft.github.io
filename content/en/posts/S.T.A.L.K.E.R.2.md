This year has been packed with awesome new releases! And now, on November 20, the long-awaited S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has finally launched!

My wife has a friend who works as a narrative designer at GSC, so we‚Äôve been eagerly anticipating the release of Stalker with twice the excitement.

I‚Äôll definitely write a review later, but for now, I‚Äôm joining the Ukrainian mainstream in eagerly waiting for the game to finish downloading üòÅ
