All this time I’ve been silent because, quite unexpectedly, I started developing a game in the spirit of Phasmophobia, but adapted for mobile devices… I’m writing it in EcmaScript (JavaScript), which means it’s designed to run in the browser. It’s a long story, but it’s too early to tell. I plan to finish development by Halloween.

The latest issue of Spirits Show is dedicated to the recent Walpurgis Night, and I’ll also be publishing the promised article on shotguns soon.
