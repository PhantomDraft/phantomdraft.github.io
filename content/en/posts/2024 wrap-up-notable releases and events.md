## 2024 Wrap-Up: Notable Releases and Events

As 2024 comes to an end, I‚Äôd like to highlight some intriguing releases and events. Keep in mind, this is strictly my personal selection, and I‚Äôm well aware of its limited scope. Don‚Äôt hold it against me if I missed something interesting‚Äîfeel free to share your thoughts in the comments!

In an ideal world, I would have written a review for every mentioned project, but life isn‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôve been busy, and my reviews this year have been limited. I promise to catch up next year!

## The Year of Anticipated Releases

Looking at the releases below, it feels like this year might have been too packed for its own good. Which continuations of iconic game series did we get in 2024?

### Creepy Tale 4

A continuation of the eerie fairy-tale-inspired series, where players unravel dark puzzles in a sinister world.
Alone in the Dark: A reboot of the classic survival horror game, taking players back to the haunted Derceto Manor with new mysteries to uncover.

### Silent Hill 2

A faithful remake of the psychological horror classic, following James Sunderland‚Äôs journey into the foggy town to search for his deceased wife.

### S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2

A long-awaited sequel set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, blending survival, exploration, and supernatural threats.

And while that seems like more than enough, there‚Äôs still more...

## Batman and Jinx Are Dead

For Batman, death isn‚Äôt new, but for Jinx, this was a first.

I‚Äôll be posting a review of Arcane Season 2 later, but for now, you can read my take on Suicide Squad by Rocksteady (technically part of the legendary Batman: Arkham series) and my thoughts on Batman‚Äôs death here. My opinion on Jinx‚Äôs death is similar: it felt inevitable and serves as a natural conclusion. I don‚Äôt expect Jinx‚Äôs resurrection or a continuation of Arcane, as I believe not all projects need sequels. Gravity Falls never got one, for instance, and I think Arcane is in a similar category.

Oddly enough, this isn't the only game in the Batman: Arkham series that was released in 2024.

### Batman: Arkham Shadow

The second VR game in the Batman: Arkham Knight series and the first VR game to include combat mechanics. This installment serves as a direct sequel to the second prequel, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate (admittedly a complex timeline). The story allows players to embody the beloved classic version of Batman before the tragic events surrounding the Red Hood, delivering an immersive VR experience with iconic detective work and dynamic combat.

Speaking of DC, 2024 also saw the release of Joker 2 with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn.

### Joker 2

Featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, this sequel explores the twisted relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn in a dark musical format.

## The Game Awards 2024

While Arcane Season 2 is already a classic‚Äîsomething future creators will look to for inspiration‚Äîit lost to another project released this year.

### Fallout TV Series

A post-apocalyptic drama exploring the lives of survivors in the Wasteland, based on Bethesda‚Äôs iconic RPG series.

## Competitions in 2024

I‚Äôm thrilled to mention the horror story competition by the Ukrainian publisher Babai, where my wife made it to the finals.

Other notable competitions include the Witcher: Wild Hunt modding competition by CD Projekt Red. This aligns perfectly with the announcement of the new modding mode for the game‚Äîa logical response to the ever-growing Witcher fanbase.

## Remasters of 2024

For me, the top remaster of the year is Clock Tower. My love for classic survival horror makes this an especially welcome gift.

Other remastered highlights include:

The Thing: A game based on John Carpenter‚Äôs film, which itself was inspired by The Thing from Another World (YEAR) and the original novella (YEAR).
Plants vs. Zombies: Reimagined by Chinese developers.

Not exactly a remaster, but tomorrow brings the premiere of the Dracula remake (YEAR).

### Clock Tower

A remaster of the classic survival horror game, where players evade a relentless stalker in a terrifying mansion.

### The Thing

Based on John Carpenter‚Äôs cult film, players face paranoia and shapeshifting alien threats in an isolated Antarctic station.

### Plants vs. Zombies (Reimagined)

A Chinese-developed reimagining of the tower defense classic, introducing new mechanics and visuals.

### Dracula (Remake)

A reimagining of Bram Stoker‚Äôs classic vampire tale, bringing a fresh visual style and narrative twists.

## Notable Releases
