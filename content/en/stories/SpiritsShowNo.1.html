                    <p>So, Hel from Metropolis 1927, reimagined by me in the likeness of Marilyn Monroe, visits a beauty salon located in a crypt. Meanwhile, a spark ignites between her and the worker... and not just one! Those feet will be polished with a circular saw.</p>

                        A dark fantasy setting featuring an old cemetery with a crypt turned into a beauty salon for undead creatures. The crypt resembles a mysterious and magical shack, with a blank sign for future customization. Instead of a door, the entrance is a reflective mirror, creating an eerie yet glamorous feel. The overall atmosphere combines gothic and pin-up art styles, with a whimsical yet dark tone, blending the macabre with elements of glamour. The image should show the crypt from a front angle, with a more detailed view of the mirror entrance and the surroundings, keeping the spooky yet humorous feel.

                        A gothic beauty salon for the undead. The mirror is now completely empty, with no female cyborg character visible. The mirror-portal is embedded in the wall, creating a mysterious, fog-like effect, but the rest of the scene remains intact. The setting is dark, gothic, and glamorous, with a pink bench and intricate surroundings, but the focus is now on the empty mirror.

Her right foot is human, wearing a high pink matte stiletto, and her left leg, which is mechanized, shows only the back of her heel with mechanical toes visible, including an elegant sixth mechanical toe, slightly bent and pressing against the ground. The dark atmosphere of the crypt is emphasized by the stone walls surrounding her. Far ahead in the distance is a blurred stone table, barely visible due to the distance and slight blur, adding mystery to the crypt setting. The pink dress extends over both the human and mechanical leg, creating a seamless appearance.

                        A scene set in a gothic, dark fantasy cemetery where a crypt has been transformed into a glamorous beauty salon for supernatural beings. Death, portrayed as a female character with a body split vertically: her right half is a robotic cyborg with metallic details, and her left half is human with soft, feminine features. She sits in a pedicure chair wearing a Marilyn Monroe-style pink dress with pink high heels. She has an hourglass figure with a narrow waist, large bust, and curvy hips. Her right leg, including the knee, is covered in a mechanized, metallic coating. Death's face is now also split, with the entire right half transformed into a robotic, cyborg face, while her left half remains human. Her hair is now blonde, with curlers added. A man resembling a classic Hammer Studio actor (inspired by Vincent Price) is seated in front of her, his back facing us, using an angle grinder on her foot, causing sparks to fly. He appears slightly puzzled. The scene is depicted from a top-down view, capturing gothic, eerie lighting, gravestones, and the mechanical elements with sparks flying in a pin-up art style. The setting combines dark gothic elements with glamor and absurdity.

He is now wearing a white shirt, and any extra elements have been removed. His hands are bare, actively adjusting and putting the goggles onto his face. The lenses are joined as a single piece, and the goggles have a simple design without extra elements. The background features gothic arches with an eerie atmosphere, combining dark fantasy and a hint of glamour. The focus is on his confident and precise action of putting on the white goggles, with shadows and subtle lighting enhancing the mysterious and elegant tone of the scene." width="200" class="tooltip-img tooltip-img rainbow round alignleft" />

The man's features are detailed, showing his solid, muscular build, and he is working with a grinder tool on her leg. The scene captures an intimate interaction, with the mechanical leg's metallic details prominently displayed. Gothic lighting enhances the eerie atmosphere, while the crypt and salon background is subtly blurred to keep the focus on the man and the leg.
