# The Cabin in the Woods: Redefining Horror Tropes

## The Impending Plot

The story in The Cabin in the Woods takes a very interesting turn. It begins at the grimiest point that ever could be, a sterile, clinical laboratory where engineers Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley are observing a pack of college students heading for a weekend getaway at a remote cabin. The movie sets the stage straight away for a two-layered narrative: an apparent horror in the cabin, and an intense observation of the students in the lab. Before the viewers realize, they get to learn that every seemingly foolish decision the students will make is part of a ritual orchestrated clearly. The story is framed cleverly as a bureaucratic procedure, with the engineers meticulously controlling events to make sure everything is part of a dark plan.

Not only is that dual narrative pertinent to the film's denouncement of the genre, but it also signals that all the noises in the cabin are neither mere poor choices of the protagonist nor even in-the-story coincidences, but rather, hidden puppeteers with invisible strings.

## Data

The wise men do not always have the appropriate data for each type of character, and they use the hard and fast template from their classical horror tropes. Hence, the students must fit to some much-needed archetypes for the success of a ritual. These archetypes are:

### Dana (The Virgin)

The heroine who survives until the end.

### Jules (The Whore)

The first to die, completing the requirement of the ritual.

### Curt (The Athlete)

The brave leader, whose fate is determined by the system's control over his every choice.

### Holden (The Scholar)

The rational thinker, tragically doomed to confirm the ritual's fatality.

### Marty (The Fool)

The unlikely survivor whom, with his wit and resourcefulness, uncovers the conspiracy.

Engineers are ensuring the students fit the mold through subtle yet disturbing means â€” administration of mind-altering chemicals.

The only one who is sane is Marty, as his self-intoxication with marijuana is a playful trolling of the system. His knowledge of this manipulation becomes a vital factor in resisting the requisite outcomes of the ritual.

## Conclusion

By its clever retelling of the well-known narrative conventions of horror, The Cabin in the Woods effectively demonstrates that characters appear stupid not because of any incapacity or folly at the individual level, but rather because of the machinations of the outside world. It goes beyond thrills within the thriller itself; it becomes a sharp commentary on the genre's rules. Finally, it redefines everything horror actually amounts to, as The Cabin in the Woods pays off the horror film with what it mocks as the architecture of the horror trope, even in delivering only the thrills it promises.
