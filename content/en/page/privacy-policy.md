## Introduction

Welcome to Phantom Draft, a personal blog dedicated to the exploration of horror genres, located at [https://phantom-draft.com/](https://phantom-draft.com/). Protecting your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your data.

## 1. Data Collection

I collect certain information from visitors to improve the site's functionality and understand audience preferences. Data collected includes:

### 1.1. Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to analyze site traffic and visitor behavior. Google Analytics may collect data such as:

- IP addresses
- Device types
- Browsing patterns

### 1.2. Comments via Disqus

Disqus powers the comments section of this blog. When you engage in comments, Disqus may collect information such as:

- Your name or username
- Email address
- IP address

Disqus may also rely on third-party services for additional features. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Disqus's Privacy Policy</a>.

### 1.3. Cookies

This site uses cookies to enhance user experience, such as:

I do not use cookies for marketing or tracking purposes directly. However, third-party services like Google Analytics and Disqus may set cookies.

### 1.4. Embedded Content

Posts on this blog may include embedded content (e.g., YouTube videos, Instagram posts, TikToks). Embedded content behaves as if you visited the respective platform, which may collect data according to their own privacy policies.

### 1.5. Google Surveys

From time to time, I use Google Forms to gather feedback from the audience. Data collected through surveys is used internally to improve content and shared only as aggregated, anonymous results.

### 1.6. Script Control

For users who prefer to limit or block scripts, I recommend using browser extensions like <a href="https://noscript.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NoScript</a>. This tool allows you to manage which scripts are executed on websites. Please note that disabling certain scripts may affect the functionality of this site.
